# Telegram Router UX Writing & Micro Copy Improvements

## Overview
This document contains comprehensive suggestions for improving the user experience writing and micro copy in the Telegram router configuration (`services/telegram_router/config/ui.yml`). The analysis focuses on consistency, user-friendliness, clarity, and proper handling of success/failure scenarios.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Typos and Grammar Errors**

#### Line 144: `unknown_input`
- **Current**: "Did't catch that. Try /help"
- **Issue**: Typo "Did't" should be "Didn't"
- **Suggested**: "Didn't catch that. Try /help"

#### Line 208: `buy_prompt` Example Mismatch
- **Current**: "This will record a buy of 5 Apple shares at $155 each."
- **Issue**: Example shows "10 AAPL.US 150" but explanation says "5 shares at $155"
- **Suggested**: "This will record a buy of 10 Apple shares at $150 each."

### 2. **Inconsistent Messaging Patterns**

#### Success Messages Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Some success messages use ✅ emoji, others don't
- **Current Examples**:
  - Line 198: "✅ Done"
  - Line 353: "✅ Added {qty} shares..."
  - Line 343: "buy: *{symbol}* ×{qty} @ {price_ccy}" (no emoji)
  - Line 347: "sell: *{symbol}* ×{qty} @ {price_ccy}" (no emoji)

#### Currency Display Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Mixing EUR symbol (€) and EUR text inconsistently
- **Examples**:
  - Line 248: "This adds 1,000€ to your available cash balance"
  - Line 389: "Cash balance: €0.00"
  - Line 247: "Enter the amount in EUR"

### 3. **Unclear Error Handling**

#### Line 95-100: Price Result Messaging
- **Current**: "?? Keep in mind:"
- **Issue**: Confusing placeholder text, unclear what should follow
- **Suggested**: Remove or replace with meaningful context

#### Line 181: FX Error Message
- **Current**: "This may happen if the pair isn't supported or the market is unavailable."
- **Issue**: Too vague, doesn't help user understand next steps
- **Suggested**: "The currency pair {base}/{quote} isn't available. Try common pairs like USD EUR or check if your currencies are supported."

### 4. **Missing Context and Guidance**

#### Authorization Message (Line 188)
- **Current**: "Not authorized."
- **Issue**: Too abrupt, no guidance for legitimate users
- **Suggested**: "You're not authorized to use this bot. Contact the administrator if you believe this is an error."

#### Remove Not Owned (Line 363)
- **Current**: "You do not hold *{symbol}* in this portfolio."
- **Issue**: No suggested next steps
- **Suggested**: "You don't hold *{symbol}* in your portfolio. Use /portfolio to see your current holdings."

### 5. **Inconsistent Command Examples**

#### Market Suffix Examples
- **Issue**: Inconsistent use of market suffixes across commands
- **Examples**:
  - Line 86: "NVDA GOOG ZAL.DE" (mixing .US default and .DE explicit)
  - Line 87: "TSLA.XETRA" (using .XETRA)
  - Line 207: "AAPL.US" (always explicit)

### 6. **User Experience Flow Issues**

#### Cash Zero State (Line 388-392)
- **Current**: Shows only cash_add example
- **Issue**: Missing context about what cash is used for in portfolio
- **Suggested**: Add explanation like "Cash is used for new purchases and shows your available investment funds."

#### Portfolio Empty State (Line 409-421)
- **Issue**: Good guidance but could be more encouraging and clear about portfolio benefits
- **Enhancement Needed**: Add brief explanation of what portfolio tracking provides
