Files to remove due to overlap with existing architecture:
- app/core/parsers.py (overlaps with validator.py)
- app/handlers/portfolio.py (bypasses ui.yml architecture)
- app/handlers/__init__.py (not needed)
- config/router_copies.yaml (duplicates ui.yml content)
- config/router_config.yaml (should be in settings)
